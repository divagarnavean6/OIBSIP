# TASK-1 IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 



## The task is to train a machine learning model to classify the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. The iris flower dataset contains 150 samples with four features - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, and three classes of iris flower species - setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Here are the steps to build a machine learning model for iris flower classification:

### 1.Import required libraries - In the given code snippet, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.pyplot libraries are imported using the import statement.

### 2.Load dataset - The iris dataset is loaded using the read_csv method of Pandas library by specifying the file path. The loaded dataset is stored in a Pandas dataframe variable 'iris'.

### 3.Data exploration - A brief overview of the iris dataset is printed using the print statement and the describe method. The describe method provides summary statistics of the dataset.

### 4.Data preparation - In this step, the dataset is split into two parts: input features (X) and output labels (y). The input features are the four columns containing sepal length,sepal width,petal length,and petal width, while the output labels are the 'Species' column. The values in the 'Species' column are mapped to numerical labels using the LabelEncoder method of Scikit-learn.

### 5.Data splitting - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split method of Scikit-learn. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

### 6.Model training - A machine learning model is trained using the training data. In this example, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used. The fit method of the SVM classifier is used to train the model.

### 7.Model evaluation - The performance of the trained model is evaluated using the testing data. The accuracy score is used as the evaluation metric in this example. The accuracy score measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.

### 8.Model tuning - The performance of the model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameters. In this example, the C and gamma hyperparameters of the SVM classifier are tuned using a grid search method.The GridSearchCV method of Scikit-learn is used for hyperparameter tuning.

### The given code snippet loads the iris dataset and prints a brief overview of the dataset. The loaded dataset is stored in a variable 'iris'. The 'describe' method of Pandas is used to print the summary statistics of the dataset. The dataset contains 150 samples with four features and one target variable. The target variable has three classes - setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

### the given code snippet is an initial step in the process of building a machine learning model for the iris flower classification. Further steps, such as data preparation, data splitting, model training, and model evaluation, are required to build a complete machine learning model.
