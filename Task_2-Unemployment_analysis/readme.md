# OIBSIP-DATA-SCIENCE-Task-2 Unemployment Predictions 

### 1.Import necessary libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express.

### 2.Load the unemployment data from a CSV file using Pandas' read_csv function.

### 3.Print the first five rows of the data using the head() function to check if the data has been loaded correctly.

### 4.Check for any missing values in the data using the isnull() function and summing up the missing values for each column using the sum() function.

### 5.Rename the columns in the data using the columns attribute.

### 6.Create a heatmap using Seaborn to visualize the correlation between the different columns in the data.

### 7.Create a histogram using Seaborn to visualize the unemployment rate (EE) for each state in India.

### 8.Create another histogram using Seaborn to visualize the employment to population ratio (EUR) for each state in India.

### 9.Create a sunburst plot using Plotly Express to visualize the unemployment rate (EUR) for each state in India by region.

## The data used in this code contains information about the unemployment rate, employment to population ratio, and labor force participation rate for each state in India from May 2019 to April 2020. The code uses different visualization techniques to explore the data and understand the unemployment situation in India during this period.
