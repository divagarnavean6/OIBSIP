# TASK-3 CAR PRICE PREDICTION

## Car price prediction is a regression problem where the goal is to predict the price of a car based on different features of the car. In this project, we can use machine learning to train a model that can predict car prices based on the features provided in the dataset. The steps to train a car price prediction model are as follows:

## 1.Collect and preprocess the data: Collect the dataset with features of the car and the corresponding prices. Preprocessing the data involves removing irrelevant columns, handling missing data, and encoding categorical data if present.

## 2.Visualize and analyze the data: Explore the data using different plots and graphs to gain insights about the features that are most important for the model.

## 3.Split the data into training and testing sets: Split the data into training and testing sets, where the model is trained on the training set, and the performance is evaluated on the testing set.

## 4.Choose an appropriate model: Choose a regression algorithm that is suitable for the problem at hand. Examples of regression algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.

## 5.Train the model: Train the chosen model on the training data.

## 6.Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model using different metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## 7.Optimize the model: Improve the performance of the model by tuning the hyperparameters of the model and trying different feature selection techniques.

## The code provided reads in a car price dataset from a CSV file and displays the first five rows of the dataset using the head() function. It then checks for missing data in each column using the isnull().sum() function and displays information about the dataset using the info() function. Finally, it prints the unique car names in the dataset using the unique() function.

## The code uses the following libraries:

### NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python.
### Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
### Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
### Seaborn: A library for making statistical graphics in Python.
### Scikit-learn: A library for machine learning in Python.

## The code also imports the train_test_split function and the DecisionTreeRegressor algorithm from scikit-learn. The train_test_split function is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets, and the DecisionTreeRegressor algorithm is used as the model to train and predict car prices.
